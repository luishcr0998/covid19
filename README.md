# Synthetic Interventions on COVID-19 Fatalities

This project aims to analyze the impact of mobility restrictions on COVID-19 fatalities. By using statistical methods and machine learning algorithms, we simulate various intervention scenarios to understand their potential effects on reducing the number of deaths caused by the virus.

## Objectives
- To develop a robust model for simulating synthetic interventions.
- To analyze the effectiveness of different intervention strategies.

## Methodology
1. Data Collection: Gather COVID-19 related data from JHU.
2. Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data for analysis.
3. Model Development: Build and train models to simulate interventions.
4. Scenario Analysis: Run simulations to evaluate the impact of different interventions.
5. Results Interpretation: Analyze and interpret the results to draw meaningful conclusions.

## Tools and Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Run the Jupyter notebooks to reproduce the analysis and simulations.
